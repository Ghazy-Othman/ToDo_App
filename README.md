# To Do App

Hello Coders .<br>
This is my ToDo app . <br>
I made it in way to learn local storing . <br>
I used Shared Preferences library to store the info I want locally . <br>
I used Provider as state management and I like it in realy , more than GetX :) . <br>
The app has three main operations to do with tasks : 
  * Add task .
  * Delete task.
  * Mark task as done .
<br>
And sure , very simple Ui . <br>
I hope U all like it . <br>
